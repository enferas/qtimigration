# QTI Migration Tool & Pyslet #

The QTI Migration tool is a tool for converting data marked up with QTI v1 into data marked up with QTI v2.

Pyslet is a Python package for _Standards in Learning Education and Training_.  It implements a number of standards, including IMS QTI, IMS Content Packaging, OData and more!  Pyslet is the engine behind the migration tool but can be used independently as a support module for your own Python applications.  Pyslet is no longer maintained here, for more information see http://www.pyslet.org/

This Google Code project remains the best site for maintenance of the QTI migration tool (desktop application).
